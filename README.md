# Car-Project
This repository contains code for creating a car controlled by your keyboard using C. The car also has a self driving mode, which uses two IR sensors to guide the car around a track made of black electrical tape on a floor of light color (oreferable white/tan). There is also a second self driving mode, in which the car follows a red laser pointer using a camera mounted to the front of the car. Lastly, there is a program that uses an accelerometer mounted to the car to track the speed/distance that the car traveled. To run the programs, enter make then ./(name of executable). A list of possible commands will be printed to the console at the start of the program. Consider using VNC viewer for access to the Raspberry Pi without a monitor, from your laptop. 

Key Components to the project:

1. 4 wheel small car with 4 motors
2. Motor driver board
3. Raspberry Pi 4
4. Breadboard
5. Solder Gun
6. Infared sensors
7. Accelerometer
8. Camera for RPi

Important folders:

1. HW7: Self driving using IR sensor, Manual mode using keyboard, track distance/speed using accelerometer
2. HW9: Manual driving using keyboard (m1 mode), follow laser pointer (m2 mode)
